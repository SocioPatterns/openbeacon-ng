1.  INTRODUCTION

Active  2.4 GHz RFID Realtime Proximity and Position Tracking us-
ing the BlueTooth Low Energy (BLE) compatible nRF51822 chip  from
Nordic Semiconductors.

Location  tracking  using  OpenBeacon  tags can be implemented by
running an  OpenBeacon  proximity  tag  firmware  that  regularly
transmits  beacon  packets.  Such packets can then be received by
OpenBeacon EasyReader PoE II base stations in the vicinity.  Sig-
nals  received  by  one or more base stations can then be used to
estimate the position of the tag.

The proximity feature additionally allows to resolve  human  con-
tacts  by  sending detecting other tags in a range of up to 6 me-
ters and a resolution of approximately 0.5 meters. Once a contact
is detected, that information is forwarded by the surrounding PoE
Ethernet readers to the server infrastructure. Due to the shield-
ing  effect  of the body, face-to-face contacts can be accurately
detected. Optional encryption can make sure, that only base  sta-
tions inside the system can read the packet information.

2.  ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

Although  the  code  contributions are acknowledged in the source
code  headers  and  history  log  files  of  the  GIT  repository
(http://goo.gl/qvqoX1),  this  project lives from invaluable user
contributions like rigorous testing, constant suggestion  of  new
features and regular real-life deployments in the field.

The  OpenBeacon Team wants to thank Ciro Cattuto from ISI Founda-
tion for the great collaboration during  the  joint  development,
the  ongoing moral support and innovative deployments of our RFID
systems.

We especially want to thank Ciro and the SocioPatterns collabora-
tion  for  providing  the scientific background for our platform,
the media exposure and the deployments needed for the survival of
our project.

4.  BACKGROUND INFORMATION

4.1 OpenBeacon.org

The http://OpenBeacon.org project was founded by  Milosch  Meriac
and  Brita  Meriac in 2006 at the Berlin located company Bitmanu-
faktur GmbH as an open platform for active RFID applications  op-
erating  in the license free 2.4GHz ISM band. OpenBeacon is based
on Open Source software and a very flexible and a open design  of
a reprogrammable low cost Open Source Active 2.4GHz RFID hardware
module. The RFID tag and reader firmware  sources  are  available
under  GPL  license the and tag hardware schematics are available
under the open Creative Commons license. We encourage the  devel-
opment  of  new ideas for OpenBeacon setups and firmware improve-
ments.

4.2 SocioPatterns

SocioPatterns (http://www.sociopatterns.org) is an  international
research  collaboration  that  uses wearable proximity sensors to
map human spatial behavior in a variety of environments  such  as
schools,  hospitals,  offices  and  social gatherings. During the
last 6 years, the SocioPatterns researchers have designed and su-
pervised  over  25 data collection campaigns in 10 countries, in-
volving over 50,000 subjects. The resulting  high-resolution  so-
cial   networks,   shared   with  the  public  whenever  possible
(http://www.sociopatterns.org/datasets/), have been used  to  in-
vestigate  human  mobility,  time-varying social networks, infec-
tious disease dynamics, location-based services,  and  more.  The
results are reported in 30+ peer-reviewed scientific publications
(http://www.sociopatterns.org/publications/) and have  been  fea-
tured    by   the   international   press   (http://www.sociopat-
terns.org/press/).

The SocioPatterns collaboration was founded  by  researchers  and
developers from the following institutions and companies:

- ISI Foundation -- Turin, Italy

- CNRS - Centre de Physique Theorique -- Marseille, France

- ENS Lyon - Laboratoire de Physique -- Lyon, France

- Bitmanufactory -- Cambridge, United Kingdom
